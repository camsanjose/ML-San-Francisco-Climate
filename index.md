# San Francisco Dew Point Prediction

We used the dataset of hourly metereological data from the San Francisco International airport from the package `stationaRy` which has over 29,729 stations available from the Integrated Surface Dataset (ISD), maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

For this dataset, we considered 17,520 observations, with ten variables and predicted the variable `dew_point`, which is the cause of saturation of water in the air.

We first make a pre-processing of the data to then develop the feature engineering followed by the model selection. We consider various forms of model selection: ssubset selection,
